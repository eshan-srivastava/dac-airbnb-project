# Problem Statement 
This should be a brief description of the domain of your dataset (e.g. if it is the Titanic Dataset then write about the ship, the incident that happened, what you're trying to do with the data). You can go check out the accompanying blog, [link to be put]

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) from Kaggle. If the task is a classification task, then you must specify the number of classes and give a 1 line description of each class as follows. 

The class labels are:
<br>

**1. Iris Setosa:** Given iris flower belongs to the Setosa species
<br>
**2. Iris Virginica:** Given iris flower belongs to the Virginica species
<br>
**3. Iris Versicolor:** Given iris flower belongs to the Versicolor species

If the task is a regression task, then explain the target variable and give brief statistics.(e.g. Housing Prices)

**Target Variable: SalePrice**
<br>
<br>
Sale Price refers to the selling price of the house.
<br>
**Mean Selling Price:** 121,000$
<br>
**Max Selling Price:** 1,000,000$
<br>
**Min Selling Price:** 45,000$


## Model(s) Used

This needs to be a description of the model used and a brief overview of how it works in theory (e.g taken of a CNN Model): 


<br>



## Future Work
Good ideas or strategies that you were not able to implement which you think can help  improve performance.

# Problem Statement 
This should be a brief description of the domain of your dataset (e.g. if it is the Titanic Dataset then write about the ship, the incident that happened, what you're trying to do with the data). You can go check out the accompanying blog, [link to be put]

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) from Kaggle. 

**Target Variable: Price (in dollars)**
<br>
<br>
Price refers to the price for the Airbnb listing.
<br>
**Mean Listing Price:** 153$
<br>
**Max Listing Price:** 10,000$
<br>
**Min Listing Price:** 0
<br>
**Standard Deviation:** 240
<br>
**3rd Quartile:** 175$

Given the input of some parameters (like room type, nights to stay) we can predict the Target Variable and thus recommend listings based on price that the model predicts. 
## Model(s) Used

We have plans to mostly used regression models: 
# Linear Regression 

# Lasso Regression

# K Cross Validation for validation

<br>


## Future Work
We can implement classification algorithms and expand our prediction model to predict neighbourhoods in NYC to have a vacation in.

# Problem Statement 
Airbnb, Inc. is an American company that operates an online marketplace for lodging, primarily homestays for vacation rentals, and tourism activities. Based in San Francisco, California, Airbnb does not own any of the listed properties; instead, it profits by receiving commission from each booking. Since NYC is a dense human traffic spot, hotels and lodgings are very much in business. Thus, being able to know (**predict**) the price of Airbnb listings is useful.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [New York City Airbnb Open Data](https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data) from Kaggle. It contains Airbnb listings and metrics in NYC, NY, USA (2019).

**Target Variable: Price (in dollars)**
<br>
<br>
Price refers to the price for the Airbnb listing.
<br>
**Mean Listing Price:** 153$
<br>
**Max Listing Price:** 10,000$
<br>
**Min Listing Price:** 0
<br>
**Standard Deviation:** 240
<br>
**3rd Quartile:** 175$

Given the input of some parameters (like room type, nights to stay) we can predict the Target Variable and thus recommend listings based on price that the model predicts. 
## Model(s) Used

We have plans to mostly used regression models: 
# Linear Regression

# Logistic Regression

# Lasso Regression

# K Cross Validation for validation

<br>


## Future Work
We plan to use **Residual Plots** to improve accuracy of our regression models. We can implement classification algorithms and expand our prediction model to predict neighbourhoods in NYC to have a vacation in.
